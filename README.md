# 💳 MicroPay - Payment Service

**MicroPay-Payment** is the **heart** of MicroPay’s transaction flow ecosystem — a distributed, event-driven **Wallet Application**.

It manages and coordinates all payment-related transactions through **Saga Orchestration** and asynchronous communication between multiple microservices.

---

## 🧩 System Context

**MicroPay** consists of six independent microservices:

| Service | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Gateway | Central API gateway for routing and load balancing |
| Security | Handles authentication and authorization |
| **Payment** | Orchestrates the payment lifecycle |
| Wallet | Maintains wallet balance and reservations |
| Transaction | Records and tracks transaction states |
| Notification | Sends notifications to users |

> Four services — **Payment**, **Wallet**, **Transaction**, and **Notification** — communicate asynchronously via **RabbitMQ**.

---

## ⚙️ Core Responsibilities

The **Payment Service** acts as the **central coordinator** for all transaction workflows.  
It:
- Initiates, validates, and processes payment requests.  
- Implements **Saga orchestration** to ensure distributed consistency.  
- Coordinates asynchronous events across other microservices.  
- Handles failure recovery and compensation logic.

## 🔌 REST Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `/transfer` | `POST` | Wallet → Wallet transaction |
| `/top-up` | `POST` | External Provider → Wallet transaction |
| `/withdraw` | `POST` | Wallet → External Provider transaction |

---

## 🧠 Internal Design

To ensure scalability and extensibility, the Payment Service uses the **Strategy Pattern** for payment processing.

- **Three core processor services:**
  - `TopUpProcessorService`
  - `TransferProcessorService`
  - `WithdrawalProcessorService`

Two of them (TopUpProcessorService, WithdrawalProcessorService) use a strategy registry:
```java
Map<PaymentKey, PaymentProcessor> registry;
```
This allows automatic processor selection based on payment source and destination type.
New payment types can be added by simply registering a new processor — no changes to existing code.
## 🐇 Asynchronous Flow (Simplified)
- Payment Service initiates the transaction cycle.
- Coordinates processing and validation events.
- Updates wallet and transaction states asynchronously.
- Sends success/failure notifications at completion.
## 🚀 Deployment
All MicroPay services are:
- Built with Gradle
- Containerized using Docker
- Deployed and tested in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Designed for Kubernetes orchestration
## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Java 21
- Spring Boot
- RabbitMQ
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Docker & Kubernetes
- Gradle
- JUnit & Mockito
- Prometheus & Grafana(later)
